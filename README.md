# Real-Time Civic Issue Reporting Platform

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Real-Time Civic Issue Reporting Platform** is a web-based application designed to improve communication, transparency, and efficiency between citizens and public service departments.

In traditional complaint systems, public issues such as road damage, street light failures, garbage overflow, and water leakage are often poorly tracked, leading to delays and lack of accountability.

This system allows citizens to report public issues online by submitting important details such as title, description, category, location, and image evidence. Once submitted, the issue is stored in a centralized database and assigned to the appropriate department for action.

The platform ensures transparency and accountability by maintaining a structured status tracking and logging system for every complaint.
